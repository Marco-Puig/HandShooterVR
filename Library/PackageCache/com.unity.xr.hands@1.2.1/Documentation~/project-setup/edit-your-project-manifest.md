# Edit the project manifest

You can edit the [project manifest](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-manifestPrj.html) to add the XR Hands package to your project. The project manifest identifies which packages Unity should use for the project.

> [!TIP]
> XR Hands 1.2 is compatible with Unity Editor versions 2021.3 and newer, but it does not appear in the Package Manager window before 2023.1. 

Follow the steps below to manually edit your project manifest file:

1. In the **Project** window, right-click on **Packages** and choose the **Show in Explorer** (Windows) or **Show in Finder** (Mac) option.

2. Open `Packages/manifest.json` in a text editor.

3. Under "dependencies", add:

   `"com.unity.xr.hands": "1.2.1"`

	![A sample project manifest is shown in a text editor. The line containing "com.unity.xr.xr.hands" is called out.](../images/project-manifest.png)<br />*A typical manifest with the XR Hands package version 1.2.1 added*

   All edits must use correct JSON syntax.

4. Save your changes.

> [!NOTE] 
> If the Editor is open, Unity imports your chosen version of XR Hands when the Editor regains focus. Otherwise, Unity imports packages when you open the project.

See [Package states and lifecycle](xref:upm-lifecycle) for more information about how Unity manages packages.
